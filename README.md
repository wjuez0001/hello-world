CSC Week 8 Exercise - Create First Repository
Students Log: Earth Date 03.05.2020. This is my first entry as a GitHub user, Wesley Juezan, for my coding class CSC201 at Tidewater Community College. I am excited to learn about this version control and collaboration software/service.  We are currently learning about structs and unions in Chapter 10 of our text prior to taking our Unit 2 exam.
